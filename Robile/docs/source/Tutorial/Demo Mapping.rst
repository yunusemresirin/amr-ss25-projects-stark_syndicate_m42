Tutorial for Mapping
====================

In this tutorial we create a map of an environment using grid mapping from slam_toolbox

**Prerequisites**

  If not already done, install following packages

  .. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install ros-humble-slam-toolbox ros-humble-navigation2 ros-humble-nav2-bringup ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard

  Make sure you have connected to the wifi network **Robile5G**. In one of terminals, ssh to the robot (please add these as aliases in ~/.bashrc for convenience)

  .. code-block:: bash

    -  ssh -x studentkelo@192.168.0.101   [while connecting to Robile1]     
    -  ssh -x studentkelo@192.168.0.102   [while connecting to Robile2]     
    -  ssh -x studentkelo@192.168.0.103   [while connecting to Robile3]     
    -  ssh -x studentkelo@192.168.0.104   [while connecting to Robile4] 

  - Password (for all robiles): **area5142**
  - It is recommended to ssh to robot only to launch the robot and to kill the robot. For all other purposes, it is recommended to use the terminal of **your** system
  - Make sure to set the environment variable **ROS_DOMAIN_ID** to respective robot id while publishing/subscribing to any ros topics from **your** terminal. Eg: while using Robile1,  `export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1`

  To launch the robot in **simulation**, run the following command in a new terminal

  .. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch robile_gazebo gazebo_4_wheel.launch.py

  To launch the **real-robot**, run the bringup launch file in a tmux session (refer to `Demo Communication <https://robile-amr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/Tutorial/Demo%20Communication.html>`_   for more details on tmux). Main steps are as follows,

  Create a new session by running the following command in the terminal where the robot's terminal is ssh-ed (replace **session_name** with any name of your choice)
    
  .. code-block:: bash
    
    tmux new -s session_name

  Now run the following command to launch the robot drivers

  .. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch robile_bringup robot.launch.py

  To detach the tmux session, press **Ctrl+b** and then press **d**. To attach the tmux session, run the following command (replace **session_name** with the name of the session you created)

  .. code-block:: bash

    tmux attach -t session_name [or] tmux a -t session_name


**Creating a Map**

  Run mapping node, and move the robot around the environment

  .. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch robile_navigation online_async.launch.py


  If using the robot in simulation, control the robot using teleop keys
  
  .. code-block:: bash

      ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard

  To visualize the robot in rviz2 while using real robot, run the following command in a new terminal. Make sure that the **ROS_DOMAIN_ID** is set to the respective robile number. For example, for Robile4, it is set to the number **4**. Please don't leave space between the equal sign and the number

  .. code-block:: bash

      export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=4
      rviz2    

  To load the rviz2 config file, click on the **Open Config** button in the top left corner of the rviz2 window and select the file **robile.rviz** from folowing path

  .. code-block:: bash

      robile_navigation/config/robile_ros2_nav.rviz

  - Now you should see the map being built in rviz2 while moving the robot around the environment

**Saving the Map**

  Run the map saver: After traversing the map, go to the **maps** directory under **robile_navigation** package and run the following command to save the map.
  In the following command, replace **map_name** with the name of the map that you want to save

  .. code-block:: bash

      ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f map_name --occ 0.65 --free 0.15 --ros-args -p save_map_timeout:=20.0

  This will create two files: a `map_name.pgm` and `map_name.yml`. Please use desired name for the map inplace of `map_name`. Now you can kill the mapping node

  Finally, to use the map that you just created you need to check which map will be loaded by the navigation stack

  .. code-block:: bash

      echo $ROBOT_ENV

  If it is not same as *map_name* that you have set, then you need to set the environment variable *ROBOT_ENV* to the map name that you want to use

  .. code-block:: bash

      export ROBOT_ENV=map_name  
      Eg: export ROBOT_ENV=map_c069 

  .. note:: 
    Environment variables are only set for the current terminal session. ROBOT_ENV needs to be set in the terminal where you are launching the map_server node, which is discussed under localization
